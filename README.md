Large Language Model (LLM) designed to read,
extract and process data from Portable Document Format (PDFs), Word Documents
(DOCX), and Text (TXT) files utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
provide accurate answers to user queries, complete with transparent citations. It also
provides a User Interface (UI) with the help of Stream-Lit application.

This project implements an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) for intelligent document processing, designed to read, extract, and process data from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Falcon 7B, the system enhances document comprehension and question-answering capabilities with transparent citations for user queries.

Key technologies used include LangChain, LlamaIndex, Falcon 7B, and web scraping to retrieve, structure, and analyze information from diverse sources. The system is integrated with a Streamlit-based UI, allowing users to upload documents, submit queries, and receive accurate, context-aware responses.

Core Features
Multi-format Document Processing: Reads and extracts data from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
Question Answering with RAG: Provides precise, citation-backed answers using retrieved document data.
Web Scraping Integration: Enhances knowledge by fetching real-time information from the web.
Efficient Indexing & Retrieval: Uses LangChain and LlamaIndex for optimized data storage and retrieval.
User-Friendly UI: A Streamlit-based web interface for seamless document uploads and interactions.
